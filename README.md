The following files are required to run the analysis described in the STAR Protocol titled "Analysis of tRNA-derived ncRNAs from small RNA-Seq data: from the raw data to tRFUniverse functional analyses"

FASTA file containing the sequences of the 3’ trailer and 5’ leader tRFs -> Human_hg38lift_tsRNA_and_5leader_final_edited.fasta

BED file reporting the transcriptome coordinates of the 3’ trailer and 5’ leader tRFs -> Human_hg38lift_tsRNA_and_5leader_final_edited.bed

R script that should be used to combine the output files generated by MINTmap and BEDtools to generate a single matrix reporting the raw non-normalized counts -> make_tRF_count_table.R
