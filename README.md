The following files are required to run the analysis described in the STAR Protocol titled **"Analysis of tRNA-derived ncRNAs from small RNA-Seq data: from the raw data to tRFUniverse functional analyses"**

***Human_hg38lift_tsRNA_and_5leader_final_edited.fasta*** -> FASTA file containing the sequences of the 3’ trailer and 5’ leader tRFs

***Human_hg38lift_tsRNA_and_5leader_final_edited.bed*** -> BED file reporting the transcriptome coordinates of the 3’ trailer and 5’ leader tRFs

***make_tRF_count_table.R*** -> R script that should be used to combine the output files generated by MINTmap and BEDtools to generate a single matrix reporting the raw non-normalized counts

***NCI60_metadata.xlsx*** -> Excel file reporting the metadata for the NCI-60 cell lines
